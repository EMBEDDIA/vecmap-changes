Two scripts derived from vecmap repository (https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap) (clone the linked repo first then add the scripts from this repo to the vecmap folder).

`map_with_matrix.py` is `map_embeddings.py` script from original vecmap repo, edited just so that the matrix (matrices) calculated during the mapping are saved in a .npz file.
`eval_analogy_cl.py` is `eval_analogy.py` script, edited for evaluation on cross-lingual word analogy datasets.
