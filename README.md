# vecmap-changes

Two scripts derived from vecmap repository (https://github.com/artetxem/vecmap) (clone the linked repo first then add the scripts from this repo to the vecmap folder).

`map_with_matrix.py` is edited `map_embeddings.py` script from original vecmap repo. The difference is that the matrix (matrices) calculated during the mapping is/are saved in a .npz file.
`eval_analogy_cl.py` is edited `eval_analogy.py` script from original vecmap repo. It was edited to allow evaluation on cross-lingual word analogy datasets.
